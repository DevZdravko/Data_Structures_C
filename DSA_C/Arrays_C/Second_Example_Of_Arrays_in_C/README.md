In this example, we declare a 2D array named matrix with three rows and three columns. We initialize it with some values using nested curly braces.

We can access and update elements of the array using the row and column index, just like in the previous example with a 1D array.

We can also iterate over the elements of the array using nested loops. In this case, we have an outer loop that goes over the rows, and an inner loop that goes over the columns.
