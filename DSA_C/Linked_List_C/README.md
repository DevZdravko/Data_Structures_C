This implementation defines a Node structure to represent each node in the linked list, with each node containing an integer data and a pointer to the next node in the list (next). The linked list is initialized with a head pointer that points to NULL, indicating an empty list. The insert function inserts a new node at the beginning of the list, and the delete function removes a node with a specified data value from the list. The display function simply prints out the data values in each node of the linked list. The main function inserts some elements into the linked list, displays it, deletes an element from it, and then displays it again to show the change.
